A little webpage with some recipes

On this webpage, I will test the knowledge I have acquired so far, including basic
HTML tags, bolierplate, paragraphs, lists, etc. I will also make use of the Git 
commands I have learned and create a repository on Github.

I will enjoy seeing how simple my first project was and how much it has improved
with the acquisition of new knowledge; it will be a pleasant window of time.
